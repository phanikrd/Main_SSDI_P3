1.  INTRODUCTION  PROJECT OVERVIEW :- The purpose of this project is to develop two interactive DatePicker displays using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions that address specific programming challenges. It aims to enhance our understanding of JavaScript and its core concepts, such as functions, prototypes, and modules. 
     Purpose of Documentation- This documentation's goal is to serve as a thorough overview of the project, outlining its requirements, file structure, setup procedures, and other factors to take into account. Users can use this documentation to better understand, alter, and build upon the project as required
 2. PROJECT FILES STRUCTURE:-The following files are located in the project's directory (project2): datepicker.html: The DatePicker following files are located in the project's directory (project3): datepicker.html: The datapicker.html as mentioned in Problem 1 is implemented in this file. The data picker instances and associated logic are defined. table-template.js: The Table template (tableTemplate) implementation from Problem 2 is contained in this file. It describes the fillIn method of the Tabletemplate class. node_modules/: This directory contains dependencies, such as ESLint, which is used to evaluate the quality of the code. Using npm, these dependencies are retrieved and maintained.eslintrc.json: For the purpose of upholding code quality and adherence to coding standards, this secret configuration file outlines the ESLint rules and parameters. package.json: This document specifies project dependencies and contains project metadata.


Files' Description Each file is described in full below: datepicker.html: This code sets up a web page with two date pickers, allowing users to select dates interactively.When a date is selected, the associated callback function logs the selected date to the console.Table-template.js: This method fills in template strings in a table based on a provided dictionary object and a specified column name. It can process the entire table or a specific column. This HTML document, test-table.html, This is an XHTML document that sets up a web page for testing the TableTemplate component. node_modules/: External dependencies needed for the project are located in this directory, notably ESLint. This secret configuration file defines ESLint settings and rules for upholding coding standards and preserving code quality. package.json: This file contains project metadata, including the name, version, and dependencies. Npm makes use of it to control project dependencies.

Relations Among Files The following table outlines the connections between the project's files: The implementation files for the Date Picker and Table Template are datapicker.html and tabletemplate.js respectively. An HTML page called test-table.html acts as a test runner to run the tests specified in test-project2.js in a web browser. It shows the user the test results. .eslintrc.json is a configuration file used by ESLint to specify code quality standards and parameters for the project, and it is located in the node_modules/ directory. Package.json contains project metadata and information about dependencies, making npm's dependency management easier. The interaction between the files mostly occurs between the implementation files (make-multi-filter.js and template-processor.js) and the test script (test-project2.js). The user-friendly interface for running the tests is provided by the HTML test runner (test-project2.html). The node_modules directory is used to handle external dependencies, and the.eslintrc.json file specifies the ESLint settings

3.PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS:- The two primary issues listed in the project specs must be resolved. The specifics of each issue are as follows:
Problem 1: Create a DatePicker is the first issue You must construct a JavaScript instance Datepicker in this exercise. This JavaScript code initializes two instances of the DatePicker class.The first instance (datePicker1) is associated with the div element with the id "datepicker1", and the second instance (datePicker2) is associated with the div element with the id "datepicker2".Each instance is provided a callback function that will be executed when a date is selected. The callback logs the selected date to the console.The render method is then called for each instance, rendering the date pickers in the respective div elements.

Problem 2: Class TableTemplate
The TableTemplate class provides a static method fillIn that facilitates the dynamic population of tables with data from a provided dictionary object.This method fills in template strings in a table based on a provided dictionary object and a specified column name. It can process the entire table or a specific column.It retrieves the table element using document.getElementById(id).It gets the header row and counts the number of columns.If columnName is provided, it finds the index of the specified column.If the column is found, it uses a loop to iterate through the rows and fill in the data using a TemplateProcessor.If columnName is not provided, it uses nested loops to iterate through all rows and columns, again using a TemplateProcessor to fill in the data.

4.SETUP AND USAGE PREREQUISITES:- Before setting up and using the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place: Node.js and npm: You should have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: Node.js Downloads. npm is included with Node.js, so there's no need to install it separately. Install Dependencies: Use npm to install the project dependencies, such as ESLint, in the project directory. This will download and install the necessary packages into a directory called node_modules. install -npm Check the configuration of ESLint: Make sure the project directory has the ESLint configuration file (.eslintrc.json). This option will be used by ESLint for code quality checks. Usage The datepicker.html, tabletemplate-processor.js files are the two primary components of the project. The project's usage and operation instructions are provided below: Checking the code quality using ESLint You may use ESLint to verify the quality and compliance of your code. Use the following command to launch ESLint: run lint with the command "-npm" The project directory's JavaScript files will be analyzed by this command, and any faults or warnings that are discovered will be shown. Before continuing, it's crucial to make sure your code passes ESLint inspections. Conducted the Tests datepicker.html and TableTemplate-Processor.js are tested as part of the project using the test script test-table.html. There are two ways to conduct the tests: In a web browser: Launch your web browser and click the test-table.html file. The test runner is this HTML page. The tests will be run by the browser when it loads the JavaScript code from test-table.html. View the test results in the developer console of the browser. Remarkably, debugging is easier in the browser-based testing environment when developing.

5.OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS:- This is the html file that shows all the problems are passed.

6.TESTING BROWSER COMPATABILITY- Information on the compatibility of the tested browsers such as chrome(recommended) or its chromium substitutes. Validation- Information about utilizing web tools to validate HTML and CSS such as webstorm and chrome.
