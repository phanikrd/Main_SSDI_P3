      INTRODUCTION  PROJECT OVERVIEW :- The purpose of this project is to develop two interactive DatePicker displays using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions that address specific programming challenges. It aims to enhance our understanding of JavaScript and its core concepts, such as functions, prototypes, and modules. 
     Purpose of Documentation- This documentation's goal is to serve as a thorough overview of the project, outlining its requirements, file structure, setup procedures, and other factors to take into account. 
Users can use this documentation to better understand, alter, and build upon the project as required
     Project Files File Structure:-The following files are located in the project's directory (project2): datepicker.html: The DatePicker following files are located in the project's directory (project3): datepicker.html: The datapicker.html as mentioned in Problem 1 is implemented in this file. The data picker instances and associated logic are defined. table-template.js: The Table template (tableTemplate) implementation from Problem 2 is contained in this file. It describes the fillIn method of the Tabletemplate class. node_modules/: This directory contains dependencies, such as ESLint, which is used to evaluate the quality of the code. Using npm, these dependencies are retrieved and maintained.eslintrc.json: For the purpose of upholding code quality and adherence to coding standards, this secret configuration file outlines the ESLint rules and parameters. package.json: This document specifies project dependencies and contains project metadata.


Files' Description Each file is described in full below: datepicker.html: This code sets up a web page with two date pickers, allowing users to select dates interactively.When a date is selected, the associated callback function logs the selected date to the console.table-template.js: This method fills in template strings in a table based on a provided dictionary object and a specified column name. It can process the entire table or a specific column. This HTML document, test-table.html, offers a graphical user interface for executing the tests specified in test-project2.js within a web browser. The test results are shown. node_modules/: External dependencies needed for the project are located in this directory, notably ESLint. This secret configuration file defines ESLint settings and rules for upholding coding standards and preserving code quality. package.json: This file contains project metadata, including the name, version, and dependencies. Npm makes use of it to control project dependencies.

Relations Among Files The following table outlines the connections between the project's files: The implementation files for the Multi Filter Function and Template Processor are make-multi-filter.js and template-processor.js, respectively. A test script called test-project2.js is used to check both the functioning of make-multi-filter.js and template-processor.js. It contains changes to stop pollution of the global namespace. An HTML page called test-project2.html acts as a test runner to run the tests specified in test-project2.js in a web browser. It shows the user the test results. .eslintrc.json is a configuration file used by ESLint to specify code quality standards and parameters for the project, and it is located in the node_modules/ directory. Package.json contains project metadata and information about dependencies, making npm's dependency management easier. The interaction between the files mostly occurs between the implementation files (make-multi-filter.js and template-processor.js) and the test script (test-project2.js). The user-friendly interface for running the tests is provided by the HTML test runner (test-project2.html). The node_modules directory is used to handle external dependencies, and the.eslintrc.json file specifies the ESLint settings.
